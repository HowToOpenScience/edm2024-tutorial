## Tutorial Organization

The tutorial focuses on introducing some common open science practices and their usage within education technology along with some interactive examples on how to apply the concepts in research. The target audience is researchers, as the practices offer structure and robustness. Based on past tutorials, we anticipate 5-10 participants and will design an interactive session tailored to their experiences and questions. This approach will allow us to present a responsive tutorial and foster additional community around open science topics.

### Prior to the Conference

Prior to the conference, we will be compiling and organizing all relevant resources to be published on a dedicated website for easy access both during and after the tutorial. In addition, we will request all registrants to complete a pre-survey (using the participant registration list following the author registration/early registration deadlines). This survey will gather insights about participants’ prior experience with the topics and their specific expectations from the tutorial. We will use this data to customize the tutorial and tailor to the needs of participants.

### During the Conference

Our tutorial session will be an interactive and responsive session split into three sections. These sections are outlined below:

1. We will begin the tutorial by discussing how Intellectual Property (IP) intersects with the Open Science Framework. We'll tackle any questions or concerns from attendees with a focus on code licensing, guided by the principles from Creative Commons. We will discuss why licensing code is important, strategies to safeguard a researcher's intellectual property, and provide guidelines for both Tech Transfer and University IP protection.
2. In the next segment of our tutorial, we discuss Open Data relative to the needs of participants. We anticipate opening this section by again addressing participant concerns to frame our future discussion. This will include identifying personal, moral, institutional, or legal concerns regarding open data.
Participants will be introduced to the concept of Data Enclaves. This will cover understanding the primary objectives of sharing data (including identifying the goals of the individual research team), the relationship between Data Enclaves and GDPR/Privacy legislation, and real-world examples of accessing information via these enclaves. Furthermore, we will provide valuable resources on establishing and efficiently using Data Enclaves. We will also discuss how researchers can share anonymized and synthetic datasets, ensuring the identity of participants remains confidential. 
We will also discuss how researchers can share data sets after they have been anonymized, ensuring the identity of participants remains confidential. We will also provide insight into the creation and sharing of synthetic datasets that mimic real datasets without using actual data.  
As part of this section of the tutorial, we will also extend the discussion from EDM 2023 surrounding the right to erasure (commonly referred to as "the right to be forgotten") and how this may impact Open Science goals. This discussion will complement the discussion of data enclaves, but also encourage attendees to consider how the Open Science guidelines and mandates (e.g., NSF) may be juxtaposed with privacy legislation (e.g., GDPR).  
We will close this segment of the tutorial with a general discussion, weighing the advantages and drawbacks of each approach. Throughout this section, we will emphasize that there is not a “one size fits all” solution and that researchers should make choices based on individual goals and requirements. 
3. Finally, we will provide instruction towards sharing materials in a reproducible manner, including best practices on storage, documentation, and privacy. This will be demonstrated with an interactive example using development containers via [Visual Studio Code][vscode] and [Docker][docker]. The specific example used will be tailored based on survey responses.

### Following the Conference

After the conference, all additional resources created for the tutorial will be uploaded to the project’s homepage for preservation. As this tutorial wants to repeat and expand upon open science and reproducibility at prior tutorials across conferences, an additional project will be created on the OSF website containing components pointing to all previous conferences and resources. A post-survey will be available at the end and after the tutorial to obtain feedback about the presentation for future use. An aggregate of the response will also be made public on the project’s homepage. A Discord channel will be created following the tutorial to foster community on these topics.
